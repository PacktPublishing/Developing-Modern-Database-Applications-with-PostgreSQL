**Use the highly available and object-relational PostgreSQL to build scalable and reliable apps**

## What is this book about?
PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system (DBMS) that provides enterprise-level services, including high performance and scalability. This book is a collection of unique projects providing you with a wealth of information relating to administering, monitoring, and testing PostgreSQL. The focus of each project is on both the development and the administrative aspects of PostgreSQL.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up high availability PostgreSQL database clusters in the same containment, a cross-containment, and on the cloud
* Monitor the performance of a PostgreSQL database
* Create automated unit tests and implement test-driven development for a PostgreSQL database
* Develop PostgreSQL apps on cloud platforms using DevOps with Python and Node.js
* Write robust APIs for PostgreSQL databases using Python programming, Node.js, and PostgREST

The code will look like the following:
```
// add query functions
module.exports = {
getAllATMLocations: getAllATMLocations,
getSingleATMLocation: getSingleATMLocation,
createATMLocation: createATMLocation,
updateATMLocation: updateATMLocation,
removeATMLocation: removeATMLocation
};
```
